# News_Bot
Creating and testing a news bot that scans multiple news websites and scrapes headlines. Then the bot runs a regression analysis and if a certain threshold is reached, makes the decision to buy or sell a stock. In the future, the bot will be integrated with Robinhood or any trading platform that provides a user friendly API alongside fractional trading options.
